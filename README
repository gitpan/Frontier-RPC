INTRODUCTION

    Frontier::RPC implements UserLand Software's XML RPC (Remote
    Procedure Calls using Extensible Markup Language).  Frontier::RPC
    includes both a client module for making requests to a server and
    several server modules for implementing servers using CGI, Apache,
    and standalone with HTTP::Daemon.

    See the file Changes for user-visible changes.  See the `examples'
    directory for an example of using Frontier::RPC.  See the
    ``XML RPC: Home Page'' for more information on XML RPC.

    Newer versions of this module can be found on CPAN or at
    <http://perl-xml.sourceforge.net/xml-rpc/>.  Questions can be
    directed to the discussion board on XML-RPC.com or to the XML-RPC
    mailing list.  To join the XML-RPC mailing list visit

    Frontier::RPC is distributed under the same terms as Perl.

OVERVIEW

    RPC client connections are made by creating instances of
    Frontier::Client objects that record the server name, and then
    issuing `call' requests that send a method name and parameters to
    the server.

    RPC daemons are mini-HTTP servers (using HTTP::Daemon from the
    `libwww' Perl module).  Daemons are created by first defining the
    procedures you want to make available to RPC and then passing a
    list of those procedures as you create the Frontier::Daemon
    object.

    The Frontier::RPC2 module implements the encoding and decoding of
    XML RPC requests using the XML::Parser Perl module.

    Apache::XMLRPC serves XML-RPC requests from Apache's mod_perl.
    Frontier::Responder serves XML-RPC requests as a CGI script.

QUICK USAGE GUIDE

    Frontier::RPC converts between XML-RPC <struct>s and Perl hashes,
    <array>s and Perl arrays, and all others XML-RPC types to Perl
    scalars.

    To call an RPC server, use Frontier::Client: 

        use Frontier::Client;

        $server = Frontier::Client->new(url => $url);

        $result = $server->call($method, @args);

    $url is the URL of the XML-RPC server, like
    `http://betty.userland.com/RPC2', $method is the XML-RPC procedure
    name to call, and @args is a list of hashes, arrays, or scalars to
    pass to the procedure.  See `examples/states-client.pl' for an
    example of an XML-RPC client.

    To create an XML-RPC server, use Frontier::Daemon.
    Frontier::Daemon is a subclass of HTTP::Daemon, so takes all the
    options that HTTP::Daemon takes for setting up a server, such as
    the port number. In addition, Frontier::Daemon takes a `methods'
    option that is a hash containing the RPC procedure names and
    references to Perl subroutines:

        use Frontier::Daemon;

        Frontier::Daemon->new(methods => {
            'rpcName' => &sub_name,
        });

    The subroutines get called with the XML-RPC parameters as hashes,
    arrays, and scalars.  See `examples/states-daemon.pl' for an
    example of an XML-RPC server.

INSTALLATION

    Frontier::RPC requires the following Perl modules from CPAN, if
    not already included in your installed Perl:

<http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/>

        Data-Dumper   (in the Data directory)
        MIME-Base64   (in the MIME directory)
        MD5           (in the MD5 directory)
        HTML-Tagset   (in the HTML directory)
        HTML-Parser   (in the HTML directory)
        URI           (in the URI directory)
        libnet        (in the Net directory)
        libwww-perl   (in the HTTP directory)
        XML-Parser    (in the XML directory)

    Frontier::RPC installs as a standard Perl module

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install
